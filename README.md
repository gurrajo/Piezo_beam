# Piezo_beam
Piezo_fem_test and Piezo_beam_1 and 2 are matlab cst function files. They generate cst functions that are quick to use after they have been generated. 
The function are generated using matlabs symbolic math module for easy verification and change. 

Piezo_fem_test generate the matrix funtion for the FEM method whereas the piezo_beam_1, and 2 generate functions for the modal shape method.
